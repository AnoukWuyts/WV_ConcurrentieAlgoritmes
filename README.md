# Algebraic Specifications for Concurrency Algorithms
You can find our implementation for LiFo and Round-robin in the 'algorithms' map. Both the version which uses a list of processes and the version which uses only one process. 
If you run main in ghci in the terminal, possible algebraic specifications will be generated using QuickSpec. This output is also available in the map 'outputs'.
In the map 'proofs' there are the proofs of the comparisons of the different specifications. There is also some background information, you might need to understand some of the proofs. Finally there are some Lemma's that we used in the proofs available in the map proofs/lemma's.
